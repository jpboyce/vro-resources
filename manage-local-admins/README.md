# Manage Local Administrators vRO Workflow

## Overview
This workflow is a proof of concept for allowing the "owner" of a system provisioned in vRealize Automation to manage the local administrators on that system.  It does so on the assumption that the system is joined to an Active Directory domain and there is
a domain group that contains the administrative users.

## Workflow Schema
The scheme is shown below:
